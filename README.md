# Hand Tracking and Sign Language Recognition

A deep learning-based system for real-time hand tracking and sign language recognition, built with state-of-the-art neural networks.

---

## üß† Overview

This repository includes models and scripts to detect hand positions and recognize sign language gestures using deep learning. It enables real-time recognition of hand movements and can be integrated into applications for accessibility, gesture control, and human-computer interaction.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Hand Tracking**: Accurate detection of hand positions and movements  
- **Sign Language Recognition**: Converts hand gestures into text  
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live video use  
- **Customizable Models**: Easily add new gestures or sign languages  
- **Test Scripts**: Ready-to-run scripts for demos and evaluation

## üîß Technical Approach

The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Hand Detection**: Detect hands in the input frame using a neural network  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract key points or image features from the detected region  
3. **Gesture Classification**: Identify the sign using a trained deep learning model  
4. **Temporal Analysis** *(Optional)*: Track gesture sequences over time
